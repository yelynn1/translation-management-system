# My Express API

This is a basic skeleton for an Express API server. It includes a basic setup for routes and controllers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm is included in the installation.

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-express-api.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd my-express-api
```

Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables:

```
PORT=3000
```

Start the server:

```
npm start
```

The server will start on the port you specified in the `.env` file. If you used the example above, it would be `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/server.js`: This file is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the express app, sets up middleware, and includes the routes from the `routes/index.js` file.
- `src/routes/index.js`: This file exports a function that sets up the routes for the application. It uses the controllers from the `controllers/index.js` file to handle the routes.
- `src/controllers/index.js`: This file exports a set of functions that handle the different routes of the application. Each function takes a request and a response object and sends a response back to the client.
- `.env`: This file contains environment variables for the application. These can include things like the port number for the server and database connection strings.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
